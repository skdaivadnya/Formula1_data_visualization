A project about the data visualization techniques. In this project I have taken data about the sport Formula1. 
We visualized the data with various data visualization methods.
We use various types of charts and tables to compare the data.
This project can be helpful to understand how realtime visualization and predction works in the real world.
We use streamlit dashboard to visualize the output in the browser.
